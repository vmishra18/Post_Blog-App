# Post_Blog-App
Built a "blog post app" with Redux and context APIs. With the app, you can view a list of blog posts. Users have the ability to create new blog entries, examine their data, amend them, and delete them. The blog post can also be "liked" by users.
Following are the key functional aspects:
• Show the list of blog post.
• View details of the blog post.
• Add a new blog post.
• Edit the blog post.
• Delete the blog post.
• Like the blog post.
